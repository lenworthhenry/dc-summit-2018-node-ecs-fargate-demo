/**
 * Puts or deletes items from DynamoDB in batches of 25 or fewer via one or more
 * BatchWriteItem operations. The items may belong to any number of tables.
 *
 * The iterable of writes to perform may be synchronous or asynchronous and is
 * expected to yield tuples describing the writes to be performed. The first
 * member should be the table name, and the second should be {WriteRequest}
 * object that defines either a put request or a delete request.
 *
 * This method will automatically retry any write requests returned by DynamoDB
 * as unprocessed. Exponential backoff on unprocessed items is employed on a
 * per-table basis.
